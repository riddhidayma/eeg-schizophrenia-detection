ðŸ§  SchizoScan AI â€“ AI-Powered Insights for Mental Wellness
SchizoScan AI is a deep learning + machine learning hybrid application built with Streamlit, designed to detect signs of schizophrenia in EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals. It integrates powerful models like BERT (for feature extraction) and XGBoost (for classification), enabling precise predictions using brainwave data.
